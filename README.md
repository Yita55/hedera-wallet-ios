## Branch Policy

## Development Setup

### Environment Configuration

We assume the development machine is running MacOS 10.14 or 10.15.
To clone and build this project, the following elements are required:
- git
- XCode and its command-line tools
- (User) Ruby and gem
- Cocoapods
- Protobuf
- Apple's Swift Protobuf plugin
- The gRPC client plugin for Protobuf in Swift

We typically expect the latest version of each element unless specified.
However, we explicitly support both MacOS 10.14 and 10.15
given some developers have held back from the sweeping changes in 10.15.

We follow the environment configuration installation steps listed below.

- _Optional_: Install iTerm2  
  _Some of our developer use iTerm2, but the default MacOS terminal should_
  _do just fine._
    + Install from the following website:  
      https://iterm2.com/
- Install XCode and its command-line tools
    + Follow the instructions listed by Apple:  
      https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/
    + Verify XCode and its command-line tools are installed
        * Run the following Bash command:  
          `xcode-select -p`  
          A developer directory should be printed.  
          _On one developer's machine, this prints:_  
          `/Applications/XCode.app/Contents/Developer`
        * Launch XCode from LaunchPad or an equivalent mechanism
- _Optional_: Install Homebrew  
  _The installation of Homebrew is used for later steps, but alternatives_
  _may be possible._
    + Install from the following website:  
      https://brew.sh/
    + Verify Homebrew is installed by running the following Bash command:  
      `brew --version`
- Install (User) Ruby and gem
    + Perform the installation
        * Open your terminal running Bash
        * Run `brew install ruby`
        * Read the command output to find the gem directory name:  
          `/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/<directory name>/bin/`
        * Use the directory to know the gem user install directory name:  
          `~/.gem/ruby/<directory name>`
        * Add the following lines to your .bash_profile:  
          `export RUBY_HOME='/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin'`  
          `export GEM_HOME='~/.gem/ruby/$GEM_DIRECTORY_NAME'`  
          `export PATH='$GEM_HOME/bin:$RUBY_HOME:$PATH'`
        * Note that you will need to reload Bash or execute the above commands
          within your current session in order to follow any future steps.
    + Verify Ruby and gem are installed
        * Open your terminal running Bash
        * Run `which ruby`  
          It should output `/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin`.
        * Run `which gem`  
          It should output `/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin/gem`.
- Install Cocoapods
    + Run the following Bash command:  
      `gem install cocoapods --user-install`
    + Verify Cocoapods is installed by running the following Bash command:  
      `pod --version`  
      It should print a version string.
- Install git
    + Run the following Bash command:  
      `brew install git`
    + Verify git is installed by running the following Bash command:  
      `git --version`  
      It should print a version string.
- Clone the project from GitHub
    + Open your terminal running Bash
    + Create and change to the root directory for git projects;
      the next will create the project directory here.
    + Clone the project with one of the two options below
        * Using ssh, run the command:  
          `git clone git@github.com:hashgraph/hedera-wallet-ios`
        * Using https, run the command:  
          `git clone https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-wallet-ios`
- Install dependencies
    + Run the following Bash commands from the project directory:  
      `pod install`  
      `brew install protobuf`  
      `brew install swift-protobuf`  
      `brew install grpc-swift`
- Generate pre-build files:
    + Run the following Bash command from the project directory:  
      `./gen-swift`

## Building the Code

Build from the Xcode GUI after loading the workspace generated by Cocoapods,
which should be named `HGCApp.xcworkspace`.
